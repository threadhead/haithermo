= HAIthermo

A ruby library that implements the HAI Omnistat Thermostat protocol

== Status

The gem is not published until I create more tests and refactor a bit.

You can clone this into a directory and call it with 'require /path/to/haithermo/lib/haithermo' if so inclined.

While the library works (I'm running it 24/7) without problems, there is much todo before a first release.
